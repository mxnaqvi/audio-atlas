Background:
Audio Atlas is a JavaScript data visualizer that allows users to enter the name of an artist and get a family tree-like structure of their albums and songs off those albums. The application uses the Spotify API to gather artist and album information and D3.js to visualize the data.

Functionality & MVPs:

Users can enter the name of an artist to get their album and song data.
The application will generate a family tree or web-like structure of the artist's albums and songs.
Users can click on an album or song to view more information about it.

Wireframes:
The application will consist of a search bar where users can enter the name of an artist, a display area where the family tree-like structure will be generated. The family tree will be designed using D3.js.
