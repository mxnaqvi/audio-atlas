Background:
Audio Atlas is a JavaScript data visualizer that allows users to enter the name of an artist and get a family tree-like structure of their albums and songs off those albums. The application uses the Spotify API to gather artist and album information and D3.js to visualize the data.

Functionality & MVPs:

Users can enter the name of an artist to get their album and song data.
The application will generate a family tree or web-like structure of the artist's albums and songs.
Users can click on an album or song to view more information about it.
The application will be mobile responsive and work across different devices and screen sizes.
Wireframes:
The application will consist of a search bar where users can enter the name of an artist, a display area where the family tree-like structure will be generated, and an information panel where users can view more information about albums and songs when clicked on. The wireframe will be designed using D3.js.
